 Ben stokes is one of the finest all rounder of england. He takes an absolute wonder catch in ICC Men's
 Cricket World Cup opener 11 December 2019. An attacking middle-order batsman, he holds the record for
 England's fastest ever Test double-century, the fastest ever Test match 250, and the highest ever score
 for a Test batsman batting at number six. He also holds the record for the most runs scored by an 
 individual batsman in the morning session of a Test match.
